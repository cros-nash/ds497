    "### Levels of Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1972, Craik and Lockhart proposed their Levels of Processing theory of memory, which posited that memory recall performance is determined by the \"depth\" of mental processing of the stimuli to be recalled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Craik and Tulving (1975) conducted an experiment to test this theory. Participants were divided into groups, each representing a condition corresponding the \"depth\" of mental processing required for a task. For example, in one group, participants might see the word \"TABLE\" and be asked \"Is the word in upper case letters?\". This was the \"shallow\" processing condition. In another group, they might see the word \"SHARK\" and be asked \"Is the word a type of fish?\". This was the \"deep\" processing condition. Craik and Tulving then measured the total number of words that each participant correctly recalled on a later memory recall test.\n",

    "**Exercise 1: Demo**\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the below cell to begin a *similar* demo experiment. This version of the experiment shows you stimuli from both conditions. You will see stimuli one at a time as changing output of the cell. Each will be shown for 3 seconds only (in contrast to the original study) for the sake of simplicity. Once all have been shown, you'll be given a retention test using input windows that will pop up near the top of this notebook.\n",

    "A non-zero and in particular positive difference appears to supports Craik and Tulving's theory because it indicates that retention was better in the deep processing condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Craik and Tulving's data, like all experiments, comes from a sample of participants from a larger population. Whenever we study just a sample of people, we're going to see at least *some* difference between groups purely by chance (even having originally randomly assigned participants into those groups). In fact, this would be true even if processing depth had absolutely no effect on memory (i.e., if the theory was completely wrong). To support Craik and Tulving's theory, we'd ideally hope to see a difference between the groups that is larger that the kinds of differences we'd expect purely due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To help us make a good guess about whether the difference between the groups was due to the experimental manipulation or due to chance, we employ statistical **hypothesis testing**, which involves two hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The **null hypothesis** asserts that there is no systematic relationship between the variables of interest, and that any difference we observe in a sample is just due to random chance. In the case of Craik and Tulving, the null hypothesis is that processing depth has no effect on memory recall scores (`mean_deep - mean_shallow = 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The **alternative hypothesis** asserts that there is a systematic relationship between the variables of interest, and that the difference we observe in a sample is due to more than just chance. In the case of Craik and Tulving, the alternative hypothesis is that processing depth positively impacts memory recall (`mean_deep - mean_shallow > 0`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity `mean_deep - mean_shallow` mentioned above is called a **test statistic** and can be used to help us choose between the two competing hypotheses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 5**\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a function called `test_statistic` that takes two numpy arrays (first for deep scores, second for shallow scores) as input and returns the test statistic discussed above. Then compute the statistic on the above data and store the result in `test_stat`."

If the null hypothesis is true, then there is no relationship between processing depth and memory recall, and thus no relationship between the `score` and `condition` columns above. We can \"simulate\" a world where the null hypothesis is true by creating samples that have no such relationship but are otherwise identical to our sample. A simple way to do this is to simply shuffle the `condition` column of the data. This breaks any systematic relationship that may have existed between the two columns.\n",

    "To see exactly how likely such differences (i.e., as big as `test_stat`) are under the null, we can simply compute the proportion of 10,000 values in `null_stats` that are equal to or greater than `test_stat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This proportion is an estimate of what is called a **P-value**, or the chance, based on the null hypothesis, that the test statistic will be equal to the observed value in the sample or even further in the direction that supports the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if 4,000 of the total 10,000 values were >= `test_stat`, the p-value would be 0.40. This means that, if the null hypothesis were true, we'd expect to see a difference like `test_stat` (or even bigger) 40% of the time (if we somehow had the money to re-run our experiment 10,000 times).\n",

    "Create a function called `compute_p_value` that takes a test statistic for a real sample of data and a numpy array of simulated test statistics and returns the p-value. Then compute the p-value for `test_stat` and `null_stats` and store the result in a variable called `p_value`."

    "If the null hypothesis were true, the chance that we see a difference between groups like the one we observed is very low (less than 4%). Based on this information, we can either decide to reject the null hypothesis (in favor of the alternative hypothesis), or, we say that we \"fail to reject\" the null hypothesis. Our p-value indicates that our experimental results could certaintly be due to chance, though we'd only expect that misleading result about 4 times if we re-ran out experiment 100 times. Thus, whether or not to reject is a hard call.\n",

    "Hypothesis tests that involve permutation and simulation like the above are called **permutation tests**.\n",
    "\n",
    "More common in psychology are **parametric tests** which rely on basic assumptions about the data that avoid the need to run simulations. One of these you've heard of before that can be used for tests of differences between groups is the **independent samples t-test**. T-tests use a test statistic called a t-statistic that, like ours above, is proportional to the difference between groups, but different in that the difference is relative to the variation in the data. We will not review it in detail today, but you can use this test or other parametric tests in your projects (if they involve differences between groups) later in the course using their simple Python implementations.\n",

    "### Mental Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1971, Shepard and Metzler ran an experiment using pairs of shape stimuli. In some conditions (within-subjects), one of the shapes was the same as the other but rotated somewhere in the range of 0-180 degress with respect to the other shape. Participants were tasked to indicate whether or not the shapes were identical up to a rotational transformation (are they the same if you rotate one of them). Reaction time was recorded. Shepard and Metzler suspected that people solve this problem by \"mentally rotating\" the shapes in their minds at a constant rate, such that larger differences in rotation between the stimuli will take longer to mentally align.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data of this form for a single participant are loaded and dispalyed below. `angle` is the angle of difference between the unrotated shape and its rotated counterpart. `rt` is how long in milliseconds it took the participant to determine whether the shapes were the same."

    "Statistical tests that concern differences between groups are essentially testing for a relationship for a categorical variable (e.g., one of two categories of processing condition) and a numerical variable (e.g., reaction time or number of items recalled). When the variables that we suspect might be related are both numeric, we can instead measure the **correlation**, also known as the \"linear correlation\" between two numeric variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear correlation is measured using the **correlation coefficient** *r*. Assuming x and y have already standardized (i.e., `x_standardized = (x - x_mean) / x_std`, same for `y`)  *r* is just the average product of corresponding x and y values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r = \\frac{\\sum x_i y_i}{n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value of *r* ranges from -1 to 1, where values closer to 0 represent weaker correlation, 0 represent no correlation, positive values representing positive correlation (i.e., x goes up when y goes up), and negative values representing negative correlation (e.g., y goes down when x goes up).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 9**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a function called `standardize` that takes a single input array and returns an array of the standardized values from the same array.\n",
