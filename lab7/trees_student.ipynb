    "### Hierarchies in Cognition\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical organization is a fundamental structure in human cognition. Think about how we categorize a canary. We first distinguish between animals and non-animals at the highest level of a hierarchy. Then perhaps between birds and mammals, flying and non-flying birds, and singing/non-singing birds at lower levels of the hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collins and Quillian (1969) showed that people's reaction time to verify semantic facts depends on the hierarchical level. For example, people were faster at verifying that \"a canary can fly\" than \"a canary has skin\". The reason is that verifying flight can be done by traversing a short path through the hierarchy from canary → bird (where the \"can fly\" property is stored), but verifying the property \"has skin\" requires moving from canary → bird → animal (where the \"has skin\" property is stored). Hierarchical representations facilitate efficient information processing because properties are stored only once at the most general applicable level, avoiding redundant storage at lower levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "We previously learned how we can use similarity data to infer how people represent objects in their minds. In particular, we inferred aspects of these representations that are spatial (i.e., sets of points in a continuous space), and featural (e.g., sets of discrete features).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will learn how to infer a special kind of feature representation called **hierarchical feature representations**. In particular, our goal will be to build a hierarchy of features that characterize the objects in our data and that follow from the similarity data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchical Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "The **hierarchical clustering** algorithm, also commonly called **agglomerative clustering**, starts by treating each object as a separate cluster. Then, it repeatedly executes the following two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. identify the two clusters that are most similar, and\n",
    "2. merge those two clusters into a single cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "This iterative process continues until all the clusters are merged together.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how this algorithm is applied, let's load some similarity data for five animals:"
