Thus, we now know how $(y - \\hat{y})^2$ changes as $y - \\hat{y}$ changes. Let's think about what that means. $2(y - \\hat{y})$ is just $2$ times what is being changed ($y - \\hat{y}$). Thus, what this tells us is that the squared error changes **twice** as fast as the difference changes.\n",

    "Also recall that derivatives tell us about more than just relative change; they also tell us about direction. The sign of a derivative tells us whether increasing a variable will increase or decrease the function we're examining (the squared error loss function in our case).

    "\n",
    "$y - \\hat{y}$ does not change as function of $y$, because we can't adjust $y$. It only changes as a function of the model's output $\\hat{y}$. Thus we also want the derivative of $y - \\hat{y}$ with respect to $\\hat{y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the derivative of a constant (e.g., $y$) is 0, the derivative of a variable (e.g., $\\hat{y}$) is 1, and the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives, so the derivative of $y - \\hat{y}$ is $0 - 1 = -1$.\n",

Now we need to \"chain\" these two bits of information together to figure out how $(y - \\hat{y})^2$ changes directly with respect to $\\hat{y}$. Recall that the chain rule from calculus tells us how to do this by combining the two derivatives (taking the product of them). Thus, the derivative of $(y - \\hat{y})^2$ with respect to $\\hat{y}$ is simply $-1 \\times 2(y - \\hat{y}) =  -2(y - \\hat{y})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "But we still aren't done, because $\\hat{y}$ itself varies as a function of the adjustable weight $w_o$ since $\\hat{y} = w_o h$.\n",

    "Our MLP reached a very low MSE value, and an accuracy of 100%. This means it learned to solve the XOR problem (i.e., it learned the two categories), as well a representation that enables it to do so, all on it's own. This is in contrast to the set of three perceptrons that we pre-learned and hand-connected together in the last lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, MLPs provide at least one general way that we might explain both mental representations and cognitive processes. That is, they don't just tell us how `behavior = cognitive_process(stimulus/representation)`, but also from where `representation` and `cognitive_process` might originate **as a result of learning**. This was first pointed out in a famous paper by the psychologist **David Rumelhart** and his colleagues in 1986. While MLPs are not the only models with such abilities, they have remained a popular choice of many psychologists in trying to understand and model the mind. The position that such models can be used to understand the mind is called **connectionism**.\n",
    "\n",
    "MLPs, especially large ones with many neurons and layers, have also become popular engineering tools, meant to learn solve problems in general rather than just as models of how the mind might solve them. The use of large MLPs with many hidden layers to solve practical problems is called **deep learning**. Deep learning is one of the most popular methods of **machine learning**, or the development and application of computer algorithms that can learn to solve problems. In fact, current AI models such as ChatGPT and others are essentially just **very large** MLPs with a few extra bells and whistles. We'll explore this connection more in a future lecture."
