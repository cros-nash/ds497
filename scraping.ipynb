        "\n",
        "Our goal is to extract information from the web, sometimes from more than one page.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do this, there are two terms you need to know:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Crawling** refers to following links on pages to reach other pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scraping** refers to extracting information/data from one or more of those pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "As we learned previously, web pages are specified using HTML, and thus scraping means we are downloading this HTML.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider a simple web page like what we've seen before.\n",
        "\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
        "<html>\n",
        "  <head>\n",
        "    <title>Webpage Title</title>\n",
        "  </head>\n",
        "  <body>\n",
        "    <p>All that's on this page is a single html \"paragraph\" (i.e., sentence).</p>\n",

        "</html>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Scraping this web page is **nothing more** than automatically downloading the above HTML.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once it's downloaded, we can extract only the bits we want. In this simple example, the title and/or the sentence are our only options.\n",
        "\n",
        "In most cases, the information we want to extract is a very specific, tiny part of a page. Luckily, 99.99% of all websites you encounter will include easy ways to identify this specific content. For example, consider the below.\n",
        "\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
        "<html>\n",
        "  <body>\n",
        "    <h1>John Smith</h1>\n",
        "    <p>Age: 25</p>\n",
        "  </body>\n",
        "</html>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "The page shows the name of someone and their age using two different HTML elements. The `<h1>` element shows \"John Smith\" in large bold letters (called a heading). However, you don't have to know what a `<h1>` element is to know you want to grab the \"John Smith\" text. You can extract the text from any element whatsover, e.g., `<anytag>text</anytag>`. You could also exact the \"Age: 25\" text from the paragraph `<p>` element.\n",
        "\n",
        "The other common distinction will be as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```html\n",
        "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
        "<html>\n",
        "  <body>\n",
        "    <p class=\"name\">John Smith</p>\n",
        "    <p class=\"age\">Age: 25</p>\n",
        "  </body>\n",
        "</html>\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "Now we have two paragraph tags. We could just grab both. However, they are also distinguished. One of the elements has `class=\"name\"` inside of the start tag. The other one has `class=\"age\"`. These are called HTML **attributes** and always have the form `<tag attribute=value></tag>`. You can uses these attributes to select the content you want to extract, such as all paragraph elements that have their class attribute set to \"name\". **You do not have to know the difference between attributes** in order to use them to select content.\n",
        "\n",

Girls will be your friends - they'll act like it anyway. But just remember, some come, some go. The ones that stay with you through everything - they're your true best friends. Don't let go of them. Also remember, sisters make the best friends in the world. As for lovers, well, they'll come and go too. And baby, I hate to say it, most of them - actually pretty much all of them are going to break your heart, but you can't give up because if you give up, you'll never find your soulmate. You'll never find that half who makes you whole and that goes for everything. Just because you fail once, doesn't mean you're gonna fail at everything. Keep trying, hold on, and always, always, always believe in yourself, because if you don't, then who will, sweetie? So keep your head high, keep your chin up, and most importantly, keep smiling, because life's a beautiful thing and there's so much to smile about.”\n",
